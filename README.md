## About

My school suffers immensely from antisocial IT students, which only makes sense.
Now, this is a small thing I spun up to give them a bit of _guidance_ while calling
companies for internships, because that one seems to be hardest.

## Usage

I pre-generate with Lustre, so GitHub Pages will do the serving. Should be available at:
<https://strawmelonjuice.github.io/school_beslisboom_bellen_stage/>

## Development

```sh
bun i # Install DaisyUI and other deps.
gleam run -m lustre/dev start # Start the Lustre dev tools server
```
